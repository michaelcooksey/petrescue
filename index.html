<p>Pet Rescue is a strict No Kill Shleter for all kinds of animals. We have over 50 dogs and 40 cats housed at our location in Longwood,
Florida. Each animal here is looking for a loving home to be apart of. 
Since we are a Non profit organization donations of any kind would be greatly appreciated.

<h2>Pet Rescue's Goals</h2>

<p>Our Primary goal at Pet Rescue is to get very animal adopted into loving homes, but we also have other goals like: </p>
<ul>
<li>Getting each animal proper vaccinations.</li>
<li>Checked for fleas, ticks, worms, and heartworm.</li>
<li>We bathe the animal and clean the animal's ears.</li>
<li>All pets are micro-chipped.</li>
</ul>
